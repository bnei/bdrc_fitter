## Overview

This app allows the upload of a single .csv consisting of two columns: H and Q.
The CSV <strong>must</strong> have the two headers "H" and "Q" exactly.

It returns parameters for a rating curve of the form:
$Q = a(H-c)^b$

This app provides a UI to the Bayesian Discharge Rating Curves (BDRC) package (Hrafnkelsson et al., 2023). The theory behind using a Bayesian hierarchical model to fit a rating curve can be found in [Hrafnkelsson et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04769).

## Usage:

The app is hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://bnei.shinyapps.io/bdrc_fitter/) with a free account. Please be mindful of this and close the app/browser tab as soon as possible when you are done to conserve limited computational time.

The app is currently in an Early Alpha stage, and has <strong>bare minimum functionality.</strong>
